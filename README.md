# An e-commerce project
Within this project , I have employed a variety of cutting-edge technologies and tools to ensure robust functionality and optimal user experience. Like for state management I have utilized Redux-toolkit. In terms of aesthetics and user interface design, Tailwind CSS has been utilized to provide a visually appealing and responsive layout. Authentication functionality of user accounts is implemented through Firebase. To enhance user engagement and communication , React Toastify is integrated to provide notifications, keeping users informed of important updates and actions. Furthermore , product data is sourced from an online API using Axios. For seamless navigation within the application , React Router DOM is utilized for routing purposes.
